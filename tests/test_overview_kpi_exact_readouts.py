"""Contract for the exact-value hover readouts on the Overview KPI row.

Every card in the row carries the figure behind its rounded value in the same
hover readout -- "186M" reads out as "185,952,048 tokens", "97.6%" as "97.59%" --
so the precise number is available without widening six narrow cards. These tests
pin the parts that break silently: that every card with a readout stays wired,
that the readout survives the cursor crossing onto it, and that it borrows its
colour from the card value it belongs to.

The Cost card deliberately has no readout: `/api/usage` rounds `total_cost` to
two decimals before it reaches the browser, so a four-decimal readout would only
restate the card's own rounded figure with false precision.
